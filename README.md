# Machine-Learning-Real-world-data-R-squared-
Comparison between ML tools to conclude the one that provides the best R squared(best model).

I will be comparing between multiple linear regression, Polynomial linear regression, SVR, Decision tree regression, random forest regression.

The data set looks at AT(ambient temperature),V(vaccum), AP(ambient pressure), RH(Humidity) as dependent variables to predict the PE(Energy).
